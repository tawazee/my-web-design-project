    <h1>Doughnut</h1>
   <p>Prep Time: 30 minutes<br>Cook Time: 5 minutes per batch<br>Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes<br>Servings: 12 doughnuts</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
   <ol>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup warm milk (110째F/45째C)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Activate Yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and 2 tablespoons of sugar in warm milk. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>Mix Wet Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Combine Ingredients: Add the yeast mixture to the egg mixture. Gradually add the flour and salt, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead Dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>  
        <li>Roll and Cut: Punch down the dough and roll it out to about 1/2 inch thickness. Use a doughnut cutter or two round cutters (one large and one small) to cut out doughnuts and holes. Re-roll the scraps as needed.</li>
        <li>Heat Oil: Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>Fry Doughnuts: Carefully place a few doughnuts at a time into the hot oil, frying for about 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
     </ol>
